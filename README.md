# Epidemic-Type-Aftershock-Sequence-ETAS-Models-in-Statistical-Seismology

This project is an attempt to compare two spatial temporary statistical models in its application against earthquakes, looking at two variations of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, applying it to a region in Iran. The aim of this exercise is to compare these models and its effectiveness in analysing seismic data in relation to the events of the Earthquakes within South Eastern Iran, encompassing the city of Bam. This particular area was selected for this project due to the devastating impacts of a series of earthquakes in 2003 that resulted in the deaths of at least 30,000 people. 

## Getting Started

For this approach, the dataset used was obtained from USGS. The data retrieved consists of all Earthquakes above a magnitude of 2, recorded in the square region bounded by 26째 - 34째N, and 55째- 60째E. The time period for this study is from the year 2004 until the year 2019, which yielded 1002 observations or events. These dates were selected after reaching out to the author of the ETAS package, as there was a trend change in the occurrence time of the events from 2004 onwards (A. Jalilian, personal communication, October 16, 2019). This is a necessary assumption that needs to be fulfilled, as both versions of the ETAS model require the data to be stationary in time, as the results of the output, particularly in the case of the first model, is not reliable if this assumption is violated

The original dataset that was used was
